# Text-Generator
I made a text generator that learns how to create stories.
It learns from the book Sherlock Holmses adventures.

You can use my code freely. If you see bug or you think that i could do something better
tell me please.

alice is the dataset that i used for the model

I also added a pretrained model but its not performing very well. If you want more accurate predictions you should
train new one by yourself.
